Now there are several signed commits that come after the unsigned one, as in the screenshot "unsignedCommit.png" in this folder. So, we have to rebase and select the commit we want to modify.

Now, a lot of tutorials and answers to questions on the internet will say to use something like "git rebase -i HEAD~N --signoff" where "~N" is the number of commits you want to look back. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
At this point, I have five commits, the first of which is unsigned. That is the one I want to modify.

The problem, however, is that if I do the suggested, I get an error. 

PS C:\Users\jdwin\Documents\testRepo2> git rebase -i HEAD~5
fatal: invalid upstream 'HEAD~5'

If, however, I use "git rebase -i HEAD~4", vim pops open for me to select a commit to modify.
